                This section details our core data handling and deletion practices, designed to minimize data retention and maximize your privacy.
              </p>
              
              <div>
                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Initial Upload and Temporary Processing</h4>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Your conversations.json file is uploaded directly to secure, private cloud storage associated with your user identity and a specific processing job. Our automated Coordinator function streams this file. As each individual conversation is parsed, it is sent to a message queue for processing. Our automated Worker functions retrieve individual conversations from the queue, use Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform initial analysis, and store these per-conversation insights in a temporary, secure database (temp_conversation_insights), strictly segregated and linked only to your processing job.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Aggregation and Final Report Generation</h4>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Once all individual conversations from your conversations.json file have been processed by the Worker functions, our automated Aggregator function retrieves all associated temp_conversation_insights. The Aggregator performs further analysis and uses LLMs to compile your final, comprehensive User Report (containing both free and any applicable paid insights). This User Report is then stored in our primary database, linked to your user account.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-primary/5 p-4 rounded-lg border border-primary/20">
                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2 text-primary">AUTOMATIC DELETION OF RAW AND TEMPORARY DATA</h4>
                <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    <strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Immediately upon the successful generation and storage of your final User Report, the original conversations.json file you uploaded is PERMANENTLY DELETED from our cloud storage.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Simultaneously, all temp_conversation_insights (the intermediate, per-conversation analytical data) related to that processing job are PERMANENTLY DELETED from our temporary database.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    This entire deletion process for raw and temporary data is automated and typically completes within minutes to a few hours of your upload, depending on the size of your file and system load. We do not retain your raw conversation data or temporary processing data beyond this point.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  We retain your final User Reports (the aggregated insights) associated with your account so you can access them. You have full control to delete individual User Reports or your entire account (which includes all associated User Reports) at any time through your account settings.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  If you choose to delete your account, all your Account Information and all associated User Reports will be permanently deleted from our systems in accordance with our data deletion timelines (typically within a short period, e.g., 7-30 days to ensure against accidental deletion, unless legally required to retain for longer). This action is irreversible.
